              <p class="title"><strong>Rangamati </strong>is a district in South-eastern Bangladesh. It is a part of the Chittagong Hill Tracts and the town of Rangamati serves as the headquarters of the district. Area-wise, Rangamati is the largest district of the country.</p>
              <p class="title"><strong>Kaptai Lake </strong> This large manmade lake of Bangladesh spanning over an area of approximately 11000km2, was created as a reservoir when the Kaptai dam was built during the 1960s. The lake was created by flooding valleys and plain lands between numerous hills. This created a picturesque view as forested hills and plateaus rise from beneath the water. The government run tourism corporation and private operators offer Kaptai Lake Cruise Tours, which is worth of it. Other scenic spots are also accessible through the waterways. </p>
              <p class="title"> <strong> Shuvolong </strong>a place in Borokol sub district, located about 25kilometers (11kilometers â€“ as the crow flies) away from Rangamati. There are few waterfalls in Shuvolong area with the largest one falling from as high as 300 feet. In the past several years, this place has turned into a tourist destination due to beautiful waterfalls and the nearby market. Shuvolong is easily accessible by speed boat or motor boats from Rangamati.</p>
