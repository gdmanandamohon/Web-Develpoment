              <p class="title"><strong>Cox's Bazar </strong> is a bay-side city, a fishing port and district headquarters in Bangladesh. It is known for its wide and long sandy beach, which is considered by many as the world's longest natural sandy sea beach.The beach in Cox's Bazar is a continuous 120 kilometres (75 mi) sandy sea beach with a gentle slope. It is located 152 kilometres (94 mi) south of the industrial port of Chittagong.<strong>Cox's Bazar </strong> is also known by the name Panowa, whose literal translation means "yellow flower". Its other old name was "Palongkee".Today, <strong>Cox's Bazar </strong> is one of the most-visited tourist destinations in Bangladesh. It has yet to become a major international tourist destination, and has no international hotel chains because of the lack of publicity and transportation.</p>
              <p class="title">The beach is the main attraction of the town. Larger hotels provide exclusive beach side areas with accessories for the hotel guests. Visitors in other hotels visit Laboni Beach, which is the area of the beach closest to the town. In addition to the beach, there are several places of interest near the town, which can easily be visited from the center.
<strong> Aggmeda Khyang </strong>is a large Buddhist monastery and a place revered by around 400,000 Buddhist people of Cox's Bazar; and the Chittagong Hill Tracts. The main sanctuary is posted on a series of round timber columns. It has a prayer chamber and an assembly hall along with a repository of large and small bronze Buddha images and a number of old manuscripts.<strong>Ramu</strong>, about 10 kilometres (6.2 mi) from Cox's Bazar, is a village with a sizeable Buddhist population. The village is famous for its handicrafts and homemade cigars. There are monasteries, khyangs, and pagodas containing images of Buddha in bronze, gold, and other metals with precious stones. The temple on the bank of the Baghkhali river houses relics and Burmese handicrafts and a bronze statue of Buddha measuring thirteen feet high which rests on a six-foot-high pedestal. Weavers ply their trade in open workshops and craftsmen make handmade cigars in their pagoda-like houses.</p>
